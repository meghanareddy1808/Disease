## Structure Of The Project

- The prediction page is conneceted with a Machine Learning Model which uses Random Forest Classifier to get the results.
- Also we have a dataset used for each prediction.
- We can land into the prediction page of the app from the options in the Navigation Menu.



- Only the most relevant features are taken into consideration for prediction.


## The features taken into consideration

| Disease  |               Features                       |
| Diabetes | Glucose, Insulin, Body Mass Index(BMI), Age |



## Deployment Of The Project

The model is deployed using Streamlit library on Streamlit Share so that the app is available for usage.
